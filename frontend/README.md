## Tooling

The web application is built with the ClojureScript framework [re-frame](https://day8.github.io/re-frame/re-frame/), which leverages [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/). For the UI design and components google's material UI library [mui](https://mui.com/) is used.
